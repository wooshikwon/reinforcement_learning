    "* `Gymnasium` is a standardized API for reinforcement learning, offering a broad collection of reference environments. It's designed to be simple and Pythonic, allowing for the representation of general RL problems. Users can create environments, initiate them, execute actions based on a user-defined policy, and manage the environment's state, including resetting it upon termination or truncation of episodes. Here's the documentation you would find useful: [Gymnasium Documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org).\n",
    "* `MuJoCo`, which stands for Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact, is a high-performance physics engine for simulating complex dynamic systems with a focus on robotics, biomechanics, and other areas requiring fast and accurate simulations. It is now open-sourced by DeepMind as of 2022, making it freely available. It includes various environments like `Ant`, `HalfCheetah`, `Hopper`, `Humanoid`, etc. You can see more in the [Gymnasium Documentation on MuJoCo](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/).\n",
